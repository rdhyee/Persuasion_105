description: "Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed novel, published posthumously.\
  \ She began it soon after she had finished Emma and completed it in August 1816.\
  \ Persuasion was published in December 1817, but is dated 1818. The author died\
  \ earlier in 1817.\nAs the Napoleonic Wars come to an end in 1814, Admirals and\
  \ Captains of the Royal Navy are put ashore, their work done. Anne Elliot meets\
  \ Captain Frederick Wentworth after seven years, by the chance of his sister and\
  \ brother-in-law renting her father's estate, while she stays for a few months with\
  \ her married sister, living nearby. They fell in love the first time, but she broke\
  \ off the engagement.\nBesides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics,\
  \ with which Austen was familiar: the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's\
  \ brothers rose to the rank of admiral; and the superficial social life of Bath.\
  \ It is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of Persuasion.\
  \ In many respects, Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both\
  \ in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters\
  \ and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne\
  \ Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal\
  \ of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of\
  \ a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which\
  \ triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.\nPersuasion is linked to Northanger\
  \ Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one\
  \ volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in\
  \ Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there\
  \ from 1801 to 1805.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
